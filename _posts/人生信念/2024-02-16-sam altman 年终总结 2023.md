Sam Altman 2023年终总结 What I Wish Someone Had Told Me 里我觉得对我们有价值的几条：<br>

1.Optimism, obsession, self-belief, raw horsepower and personal connections are how things get started. 乐观、执着、自信、原始驱动力和人际关系是一切的开始。<br>

5.Concentrate your resources on a small number of high-conviction bets; this is easy to say but evidently hard to do. You can delete more stuff than you think.<br>
将资源集中在少数你深信不疑的事上；这话说起来容易，但做起来难。你能排除掉的东西比你想象的要多。<br>

10.Superstars are even more valuable than they seem, but you have to evaluate people on their net impact on the performance of the organization. <br>
超级明星比你想象的更有价值，但必须根据他们对组织的真正影响来评估他们。<br>

13.Inspiration is perishable and life goes by fast. Inaction is a particularly insidious type of risk. 灵感易逝，生命短暂。不行动是一种特别隐蔽的风险。<br>

14.Scale often has surprising emergent properties. 规模经常会带来出人意料的新特性。<br>

15.Compounding exponentials are magic. In particular, you really want to build a business that gets a compounding advantage with scale. <br>
复利指数很神奇。特别是，你真的想建立一个通过规模获得复利优势的企业。<br>

16.Get back up and keep going. 跌倒了就爬起来，继续前进。<br>

17.Working with great people is one of the best parts of life. 与优秀的人共事是人生最美好的体验之一。<br>
