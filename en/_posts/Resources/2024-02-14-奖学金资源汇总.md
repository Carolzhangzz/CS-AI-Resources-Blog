#### This year, I learned about the SenseTime Scholarship and want to recommend it to future juniors and seniors~<br>
The SenseTime Scholarship is awarded annually to 30 undergraduate students (sophomore to senior) in China who are engaged in artificial intelligence-related research.<br>
The scholarship offers a pre-tax amount of 20,000 yuan and also organizes social events. The application usually starts at the end of September or the beginning of October, with results announced around December. Corporate scholarships generally do not conflict with internal school scholarships.<br>
No harm in applying!<br>
