I strongly suggest that universities should offer a career guidance course before graduation, to clearly teach everyone:<br>
1. The components and proportions of the "five insurances and one fund";<br>
2. The national payment caps and floors for various regions;<br>
3. What supplementary housing fund and occupational pensions are;<br>
4. The calculation rules for public sector job wages, grade wages, standardized allowances, and housing subsidies;<br>
5. The composition of our pensions when we retire, formula calculation, and where the deciding factors lie;<br>
6. Understand the difference between individual accounts and overall planning accounts;<br>
7. Understand personal income tax and capital gains tax, and comprehend the composition of the taxes you pay in life.<br>
Same here.
