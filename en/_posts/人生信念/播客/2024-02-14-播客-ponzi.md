## The World as a Vast Ponzi Scheme

Ponzi schemes are illicit financial frauds that typically involve individuals or groups promising high returns on investment opportunities without engaging in any legitimate investment activities.
Named after Italian-American Charles Ponzi, who first utilized this scheme in the early 20th century.
Characteristic of Ponzi schemes is the use of new investors' funds to pay returns to earlier investors, rather than actual investments being made.
Such schemes require a continuous influx of new investors to sustain returns but ultimately collapse due to insufficient funds to pay returns to all investors.

### [Why Academia is a Ponzi Scheme]

1. In East Asia, there's an admiration for scarcity, such as pursuing a Ph.D. in the United States.
2. The Frog Doctor: Academic pursuits are challenging; most individuals fail to truly optimize and might need to delve into various topics for graduation.
3. In his field of databases, optimization is particularly challenging. Research areas may not align with societal needs.
4. Academia heavily relies on incoming funds. For instance, under a professor, there might be numerous postdocs, more than Ph.D. students, which is increasingly common in computer science.

Perhaps currently favored is AI. The Ponzi pyramid can only thrive with a large number of participants. However, with the influx of people into AI since 2012, competition for AI papers has become intense. Nonetheless, AI undeniably enhances human productivity.

Another area is quantum computing, but its proximity to success remains uncertain. Pursuing quantum computing may limit job prospects to research roles within the field, potentially sacrificing one's youth. Academic circles in North America may seek funding by "intimidating" the government to believe in the field's utility, resembling a Ponzi scheme.

### [Why Employment in Big Tech is a Ponzi Scheme]

Even working for major tech companies constitutes a Ponzi scheme. Expansion is key for career advancement, often necessitating unnecessary tasks to justify hiring more individuals. Some projects may seem futile, but directors pretend to tackle significant projects to maintain the Ponzi scheme's apex position. Chinese and American tech giants may not mind employing excess staff. However, when growth stagnates, layoffs may follow to appease investors.

### Why Ponzi Schemes Persist

Initiating a Ponzi scheme involves acquiring others' resources. Printing money in the U.S. flows into the stock market, favoring companies with grandiose promises. Convincing higher-ups to allocate resources requires substantial persuasion. In industries like tech, the absence of practical tasks is common, necessitating unnecessary work to justify positions.

### [Money as a Means of Exchange; Power as the Real Resource]

Understanding artificially controlled scarcity is crucial. Money isn't inherently scarce; it's a medium of exchange. Governments manipulate currency through interest rates and taxes to meet objectives. Power, however, is the true resource. Holding significant power renders actions inconsequential. When in control, one can manipulate narratives and evade consequences, as evidenced by certain individuals' actions.

### How Ordinary Individuals Can Survive: Joining Ponzi Schemes?

During times of monetary expansion, some companies receive substantial funding despite not achieving their goals. Predicting market trends is difficult. Entering Ponzi schemes early or monopolizing resources are potential strategies. However, participation in schemes like these is risky and relies on the belief of others.

### [ChatGPT: Disrupting Academic Ponzi Schemes]

ChatGPT is revolutionary, altering many CS directions. While some AI fields may be futile, large-scale models like GPT4 hold promise. Academic circles may struggle to advance, with only a few entities like OpenAI making significant progress. ChatGPT exposes academic Ponzi schemes, revealing obsolete fields. However, ChatGPT's productivity enhancement makes it an exception, not a Ponzi scheme.

### Summary:

The academic circle operates like a Ponzi scheme: necessary for research, yet most output is subpar, resulting in fleeting success.

The world functions similarly: nothing can grow infinitely, so we must identify growing fields and pivot accordingly. Join OpenAI now!

## General Ponzi Studies:

Like classic Ponzi schemes such as pension insurance, there's a need for continuous growth. For instance, declining birth rates threaten pension systems.

Asset value depends on future cash flows. Capitalism relies on finding new markets and bridging cost differentials.

Venture capital rounds function akin to Ponzi schemes, necessitating salary and title boosts.

### Macroeconomics:

At its core, economics is political. Historical economies aimed for political power. Debt expansion drives modern economies.

Governments use debt to stimulate economies. Debt is now used for fiscal regulation rather than expansion.

### Modern Monetary Theory and Ponzi:

Government overspending via printing money differs from capitalist investments in commerce and industry.

In China, real estate drives growth, while in the US, it's the stock market.

Understanding the investment landscape prevents getting caught in bubbles.

### Present Economic Climate:

We're in a recession. Various sectors, including academia, are part of the modern economic ecosystem, but academia might be a cultural Ponzi.

### Essence of Education:

Education perpetuates class structures more than it imparts skills.

### Student Perspective:

In China, academic excellence is paramount, but practical skills may be more valuable. In the US, wealthy donors influence elite university admissions.

### Post-Education Life:

Success doesn't guarantee wealth. It's crucial to adapt to modern society's needs.

### China's Emphasis on Academics:

China's merit-based university system may undervalue practical skills.

### Personal Value in Work:

Job security is a thing of the past. Layoffs maintain efficiency and monopolies.

### Nordic Model:

Nordic countries exemplify a unique form of capitalism with high welfare.

### Theory of Consumption:

Consumption drives economies. Assigning value to consumption is essential.

### Bakar's Theory:

Energy consumption is intrinsic to society. Wealth accumulation glorifies production over consumption.
